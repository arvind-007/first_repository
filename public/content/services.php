                <text>Search engine optimization</text>
                <p> Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and
                    quantity of website
                    traffic to a website or a web page from search engines.[1] SEO targets unpaid traffic (known as
                    "natural" or "organic" results)
                    rather than direct traffic or paid traffic. Unpaid traffic may originate from different kinds of
                    searches,
                    including image search, video search, academic search,[2] news search, and industry-specific
                    vertical search engines</p>
