            <h2> WEBSITE </h2> 
           
          When you’re making your first website, there’s a lot to do! As well as writing your HTML and CSS code, 
          you need to test your website, buy domain and hosting, upload your files and more. There are also optional things,
          like SEO, analytics and validation.
          Find out how to set up all of these things the right way and with minimal stress. Let’s build your website!
          Website Scripting
          Every website needs HTML and CSS. However, depending on the type of website you’re building, you may also need website scripting.
          Website scripting is what turns a static website into a dynamic website. It’s very likely that your website will need, or at least
           benefit from, scripting. Here are some examples of website scripting:

             contact forms
             interactive buttons and controls
             website databases
             shared content between web pages

          If you think your website will need any of the above things, you’ll need to learn a coding language such as JavaScript, 
          PHP, Ruby on Rails or ASP.NET.

          Web Browsers
          Each web browser renders HTML and CSS in a different way, so you’ll also need to make sure that your website displays and 
          functions properly in each one. The five most popular web browsers, in order from most to least popular, are:

           Google Chrome
           Windows Internet Explorer
           Mozilla Firefox
           Apple Safari
           Opera
          Internet Explorer is particularly notorious for being slow to support new HTML and CSS capabilities, and most web designers 
          find it a pain to optimize their websites for IE. Just a heads up on that one.

                <h4> Application software<h4>
                 
                An application program (app or application for short) is a computer program designed to carry out a specific task other than
                one relating to the operation of the computer itself,[1] typically to be used by end-users. Word processors, media players,
                and accounting software are examples. The collective noun refers to all applications collectively.[2] The other principal 
                classifications of software are system software, relating to the operation of the computer, and utility software ("utilities").

                Applications may be bundled with the computer and its system software or published separately and may be coded as proprietary,
                open-source,or projects.[3] The term "app" often refers to applications for mobile devices such as phones

                APPS AND KILLER APPS
                
                Main article: Killer application
                Some applications are available in versions for several different platforms; others only work on one and are thus called, for 
                example, a geography application for Microsoft Windows, or an Android application for education, or a Linux game. Sometimes a
                 new and popular application arises which only runs on one platform, increasing the desirability of that platform. This is called 
                 a killer application or killer app. For example, VisiCalc was the first modern spreadsheet software for the Apple II and helped 
                 sell the then-new personal computers into offices. For Blackberry it was their email software.

                In recent years, the shortened term "app" (coined in 1981 or earlier[7]) has become popular to refer to applications for mobile
                 devices such as smartphones and tablets, the shortened form matching their typically smaller scope compared to applications on
                  PCs. Even more recently, the shortened version is used for desktop application software as well.

Vertical applications are niche products, designed for a particular type of industry or business, or department within an organization. Integrated suites of software will try to handle every specific aspect possible of, for example, manufacturing or banking worker, or accounting, or customer service.

                         Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a
                          web page from search engines.[1] SEO targets unpaid traffic (known as "natural" or "organic" results) rather than direct
                           traffic or paid traffic. Unpaid traffic may originate from different kinds of searches, including image search, video 
                           search, academic search,[2] news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines.

                         As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the computer-programmed algorithms that dictate
                          search engine behavior, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines, and which 
                          search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors
                           from a search engine when websites rank higher on the search engine results page (SERP). These visitors can then
                            potentially be converted into customers
