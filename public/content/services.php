                             When you’re making your first website, there’s a lot to do! As well as writing your HTML and CSS code, 
                             you need to test your website, buy domain and hosting, upload your files and more. There are also optional things,
                             like SEO, analytics and validation.
                             Find out how to set up all of these things the right way and with minimal stress. Let’s build your website!
                             Website Scripting Every website needs HTML and CSS. However, depending on the type of website you’re building, you may also need website scripting.
                             Website scripting is what turns a static website into a dynamic website. It’s very likely that your website will need, or at least
                             benefit from, scripting. Here are some examples of website scripting:
                             <br>contact forms  <br>
                             interactive buttons and controls <br>
                             website databases  <br>
             
                </p>
                      <p style=" margin-left: 60px; margin-top: -15px;  margin-right: 23px;">
                            shared content between web pages.
                            <br><br> Web Browsers <br><br>
                           Each web browser renders HTML and CSS in a different way, so you’ll also need to make sure that your website displays and 
                           functions properly in each one. The five most popular web browsers, in order from most to least popular, are:<br>
                           Google Chrome<br>
                           Windows Internet Explorer<br>
                           Mozilla Firefox<br>
                           Apple Safari<br>
                           Opera<br>
                           Internet Explorer is particularly notorious for being slow to support new HTML and CSS capabilities, and most web designers 
                           find it a pain to optimize their websites for IE. Just a heads up on that one.<br><br>

                           The World Wide Web (WWW) was created in 1990 by the British CERN physicist Tim Berners-Lee.[1] On 30 April
                           1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to use for anyone, contributing to the immense growth of the Web.[2] Before the introduction of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), other protocols such as File Transfer Protocol and the gopher protocol were used to retrieve individual files from a server. These protocols offer a simple directory structure which the user navigates and where they choose files to download. Documents were most often presented as plain text files without formatting or were encoded in word processor formats.<br><br>

                           Overview <br><br>
                           Websites can be used in various fashions: a personal website, a corporate website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites can be the work of an individual, a business or other organization, and are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose. Any website can contain a hyperlink to any other website, so the distinction between individual sites, as perceived by the user, can be blurred.<br><br>
                           Some websites require user registration or subscription to access content. Examples of subscription websites include many business sites, news websites, academic journal websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, message boards, web-based email, social networking websites, websites providing real-time stock market data, as well as sites providing various other services.
                           While "web site" was the original spelling (sometimes capitalized "Web site", since "Web" is a proper noun when referring to the World Wide Web), this variant has become rarely used, and "website" has become the standard spelling. All major style guides, such as The Chicago Manual of Style[3] and the AP Stylebook,[4] have reflected this change.

                           Application software
                           <br> <br>
                           An application program (app or application for short) is a computer program designed to carry out a specific task other than
                           one relating to the operation of the computer itself,[1] typically to be used by end-users. Word processors, media players,
                           and accounting software are examples. The collective noun refers to all applications collectively.[2] The other principal 
                           classifications of software are system software, relating to the operation of the computer, and utility software ("utilities").
                           Applications may be bundled with the computer and its system software or published separately and may be coded as proprietary,
                           open-source,or projects.[3] The term "app" often refers to applications for mobile devices such as phones<br><br>

                               Application software is usually distinguished among two main classes: closed source vs open source
                               software applications, and among free or proprietary software applications.
                               Proprietary software is placed under the exclusive copyright, and a software license grants limited
                               ge rights. The open-closed principle states that software may be "open only for extension,
                               but not for modification". Such applications can only get add-on by third-parties.
                               Free and open-source software shall be run, distributed, sold or extended for any purpose, and
                               -being open- shall be modified or reversed in the same way.
                               FOSS software applications released under a free license may be perpetual and also royalty-free. 
                               Perhaps, the owner, the holder or third-party enforcer of any right (copyright, trademark, patent,
                               or ius in re aliena) are entitled to add exceptions, limitations, time decays or expiring dates to 
                               the license terms of use.<br>
                               Public-domain software is a type of FOSS, which is royalty-free and - openly or reservedly- can be run,
                               distributed, modified, reversed, republished or created in derivative works without any copyright
                               attribution and therefore revocation. It can even be sold, but without transferring the public
                               domain property to other single subjects. Public-domain SW can be released under an (un)licensing
                               legal statement, which enforces those terms and conditions for an indefinite duration (for a lifetime, orever) <br><br>

                               Some applications are available in versions for several different platforms; others only work on one and are thus called, for 
                               example, a geography application for Microsoft Windows, or an Android application for education, or a Linux game. Sometimes a
                               new and popular application arises which only runs on one platform, increasing the desirability of that platform. This is called 
                               a killer application or killer app. For example, VisiCalc was the first modern spreadsheet software for the Apple II and helped 
                               sell the then-new personal computers into offices. For Blackberry it was their email software.<br> In recent years, the shortened term "app" (coined in 1981 or earlier[7]) has become popular to refer to applications for mobile
                               devices such as smartphones and tablets, the shortened form matching their typically smaller scope compared to applications on
                               PCs. Even more recently, the shortened version is used for desktop application software as well.

Integrated suites of software will try to handle every specific aspect possible of, for example, manufacturing or banking worker, or accounting, or customer service.

                          SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION
                          <br> <br> 
                         
                          Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a
                          web page from search engines.[1] SEO targets unpaid traffic (known as "natural" or "organic" results) rather than direct
                          traffic or paid traffic. Unpaid traffic may originate from different kinds of searches, including image search, video 
                          search, academic search,[2] news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines.<br><br>

                          As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the computer-programmed algorithms that dictate
                          search engine behavior, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines, and which 
                          search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors
                          from a search engine when websites rank higher on the search engine results page (SERP). These visitors can then
                          potentially be

                             HISTORY
                             <br><br>
                             Webmasters and content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web. Initially, all webmasters only needed to submit the address of a page, or URL, to the various engines which would send a web crawler to crawl that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be indexed.[4] The process involves a search engine spider downloading a page and storing it on the search engine's own server. A second program, known as an indexer, extracts information about the page, such as the words it contains, where they are located, and any weight for specific words, as well as all links the page contains. All of this information is then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date.<br><br>

                             Website owners recognized the value of a high ranking and visibility in search engine results,[5] creating an opportunity for both white hat and black hat SEO practitioners. According to industry analyst Danny Sullivan, the phrase "search engine optimization" probably came into use in 1997. Sullivan credits Bruce Clay as one of the first people to popularize the term.[6]<br><br>

                              Early versions of search algorithms relied on webmaster-provided information such as the keyword meta tag or index files in engines like ALIWEB. Meta tags provide a guide to each page's content. Using metadata to index pages was found to be less than reliable, however, because the webmaster's choice of keywords in the meta tag could potentially be an inaccurate representation of the site's actual content. Flawed data in meta tags such as those that were not accurate, complete, or falsely attributes created the potential for pages to be mischaracterized in irrelevant searches.[7][dubious – discuss] Web content providers also manipulated some attributes within the HTML source of a page in an attempt to rank well in search engines.[8] By 1997, search engine designers recognized that webmasters were making efforts to rank well in their search engine, and that some webmasters were even manipulating their rankings in search results by stuffing pages with excessive or irrelevant keywords. Early search engines, such as Altavista and Infoseek, adjusted their algorithms to prevent webmasters from manipulating ranking
